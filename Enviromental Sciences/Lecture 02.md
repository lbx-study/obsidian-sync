### **Definitions**

#### **Environment:**

1. The circumstances or conditions surrounding an organism or group of organisms.
2. The complex of social or cultural conditions that affect an individual or community.

#### **Environmental Science:**

- Systematic study of the environment, focusing on how humans depend on and influence it.
- Aims to understand and resolve issues like pollution and biodiversity loss.
- Addresses challenges in making remedies socially, economically, and politically acceptable.
- **Interdisciplinary Nature:** Combines natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

### **Major Themes in Environmental Science**

#### **1. Sustainable Development:**

- Balancing population growth, food systems, water resources, air pollution, and energy demands.
- Fosters livelihoods under changing conditions.

#### **2. Climate Change and Climate Action:**

- Affects health, economies, poverty, conflicts, water resources, weather, food production, and biodiversity.
- Recognized as the most urgent issue of our time.

#### **3. Population and Resource Consumption:**

- **Current Population:** 8.2 billion, growing by 80 million annually.
- High birth rates in low-income countries, mainly in Africa and Afghanistan.
- Rising resource consumption with increasing affluence.

#### **4. Hunger:**

- **UN Estimate:** 800 million people are undernourished.
- Causes: Drought, floods, displacement, war.
- Two-thirds of agricultural lands show degradation.

#### **5. Biodiversity Loss and Conservation Efforts:**

- Over 800 species extinct in the past century; 10,000 species threatened.
- Comparable to the extinction event that ended the dinosaur era.

#### **6. Energy:**

- **Current Dependency:** Fossil fuels (80% of energy in industrialized nations).
- **Cleaner Alternatives:** Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass.
- China leads in solar, wind, and biogas technology.
- Solar panel costs reduced drastically (from $20/watt in the 1980s to <$0.50/watt).

#### **7. Pollution and Environmental Health:**

- Toxic haze in South Asia, causing 3 million deaths annually.
- Air pollution-related diseases are prevalent.
- Technological solutions can capture pollutants before release.

#### **8. Water Resources:**

- **Unsafe Drinking Water:** 600 million people.
- **Sanitation Issues:** 2.4 billion lack access.
- Polluted water causes over 5 million child deaths annually.
- Water shortages create climate refugees.

#### **9. Information and Education:**

- **Key Role of Education:** Reducing population growth and child mortality.
- Expanding knowledge facilitates new environmental strategies.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Biological Productivity:**

- **Definition:** Rate of usable energy production (biomass) by plants through photosynthesis minus energy used in respiration.
- **Ecosystem NPP (gC/m²/yr):**
    - Tropical Forests: 2,000–3,500
    - Temperate Forests: 600–1,500
    - Boreal Forests: 200–800
    - Deserts: <200
- Forests outperform deserts significantly in productivity.

#### **Ecological Footprint:**

- **Definition:** Measures demands on nature by individuals or nations.
- **Components:**
    1. Cropland
    2. Grazing Land
    3. Fishing Grounds
    4. Forests
    5. Built-Up Land
- **Global Usage:** Humanity's footprint is 20–22 billion gha, equating to 1.7 Earths.
- Average global footprint per person: 2.7 gha (available: ~1.6 gha/person).

---

#### **Biocapacity:**

- **Definition:** Capacity of ecosystems to generate renewable resources and absorb waste sustainably.
- **Earth's Biocapacity:** ~12.2 billion gha.
- **Formula:** Biocapacity = Actual Area × Productivity per unit area.
- **Biocapacity vs. Ecological Footprint:**
    - **Sustainable:** Biocapacity > Footprint.
    - **Unsustainable:** Biocapacity < Footprint.

---

### **Country Comparisons**

- **USA:** Footprint = 8.1 gha/person; Biocapacity = 1.6 gha/person → Requires 5.1 Earths.
- **Japan:** Footprint = 4.6 gha/person; Biocapacity = 0.6 gha/person → Requires 7.8 Japans.

### **Key Questions for Sustainability:**

1. How much are we consuming?
2. How do we quantify environmental impact?
3. Are our methods sustainable?
