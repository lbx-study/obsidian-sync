### **Core Concepts in Sustainable Development**

#### **Ecological Footprint and Throughput**

- **Throughput:**
    - Describes the amount of material or resources that flow through a system.
    - Example (Household):
        - High-consumption households → High resource input and waste output.
        - Low-consumption households → Lower input and waste.

#### **Ecosystem Services**

- **Definition:** Services/resources provided by environmental systems, often invisible or unpriced.
- **Types of Ecosystem Services:**
    1. **Provisioning Services:** E.g., fuel, food.
    2. **Supporting Services:** E.g., water purification, oxygen production by plants.
    3. **Regulating Services:** E.g., carbon capture, temperature maintenance.
    4. **Cultural Services:** E.g., recreational, aesthetic.

### **Tragedy of the Commons**

- **Origin:** 1968 article by ecologist Garret Hardin in _Science_.
- **Concept:** Population growth leads to overuse and destruction of common resources (e.g., shared pastures, fisheries, air, and water).
- **Hardin’s Solutions:**
    1. **Private Property:** Owners protect resources due to self-interest.
    2. **State Regulation:** Enforced rules to manage resource use.
- **Alternative Perspective:**
    - **Elinor Ostrom (Nobel Prize 2009):** Advocated for community-based resource management (e.g., forests, grazing lands).
    - **Conditions for Effective Commons Management:**
        1. Inexpensive and effective resource monitoring.
        2. Exclusion of outsiders unfamiliar with rules.
        3. Frequent communication and strong social networks among users to build trust.

#### **Global Commons Management**

- **Hardin:** Local solutions insufficient; policy changes at country/international levels necessary.
- **Ostrom:** Encourages smaller, local, or individual policy changes.

### **Planetary Boundaries**

- **Definition:** Thresholds of abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.
- **Identified Systems (Johan Rockström, Stockholm Resilience Centre):**
    1. Climate change
    2. Biodiversity loss
    3. Land system change
    4. Freshwater use
    5. Biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus cycles)
    6. Ocean acidification
    7. Atmospheric aerosols
    8. Stratospheric ozone loss
    9. Novel entities (e.g., chemical pollution).
- **Current Status:**
    - Some planetary boundaries have already been crossed.
    - Overshooting these limits leads to rapid declines in ecosystem functions and services.

#### **Interconnections in Global Systems**

- Example:
    - Deforestation in Southeast Asia → Heat and drought in North America.
    - North American droughts → Climate warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic.
- **Importance:** A planetary perspective reveals interdependencies and their effects on human well-being.

### **Indigenous Peoples and Biodiversity**

- **Role:** Indigenous communities protect biodiversity and undisturbed habitats, serving as custodians of rare species and ecosystems.
- **Examples of Recognition:**
    - Countries like Fiji, Ecuador, Canada, and Australia acknowledge indigenous land titles.
    - **Quote (Kuna Indians, Panama):** “Where there are forests, there are native people, and where there are native people, there are forests.”

### **Environmental Justice**

- **Definition:** Combines civil rights with environmental protection to ensure a safe, healthy environment for all.
- **Environmental Injustice Evidence:**
    - African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans disproportionately live near toxic waste sites, incinerators, or landfills.
    - Lead poisoning affects 4 million children, primarily from minority and inner-city communities.

#### **Environmental Racism**

- Inequitable distribution of environmental hazards based on race.

#### **Toxic Colonialism**

- **Definition:** Targeting poor communities, often in developing nations, for waste disposal or risky technology experimentation.
- **Treaty (1989):**
    - 105 nations signed a treaty regulating international shipping of toxics.
    - Despite regulations, millions of tons of hazardous waste still move (legally/illegally) from wealthy to poorer countries.
