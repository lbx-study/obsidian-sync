### **Key Concepts**

#### **Class Footprint**

- **Biocapacity (Global):** 1.6 gha
- **World Citizen Footprint:** 2.7 gha

#### **Sustainable Development**

- **Definition (Brundtland Report, 1987):**  
    “Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
- **Historical Context:**
    - **Rio Meeting (1992):** Hosted in Brazil; united diverse groups (environmentalists, politicians, workers, wealthy/poor nations).
    - Spread awareness of sustainable development globally.

#### **Poverty**

- **Global Statistics:**
    - 700 million people live below the international poverty line ($1.90/day).
- **Impact:** Poverty affects quality-of-life indicators like health, education, and well-being.

#### **Human Development Index (HDI)**

- **Components:** Aggregates factors like health, education, and poverty.

### **Affluence**

- **Definition:** State of wealth or high standard of living.
- **USA Example:**
    - Population: 4.6% of the world.
    - Consumption:
        - 20% of all oil.
        - 15% of all carbon dioxide emissions.
        - 50% of toxic waste globally.
- **China’s Growth:**
    - 1960s:
        - 300 million suffered hunger; 50 million starved to death.
    - Present:
        - Per capita GDP: $200/year → $12,000/year.
        - Pollution increased due to resource demand.
    - **Ecological Footprints:**
        - USA: 9.7 gha/year.
        - China: 2 gha/year.

### **Is Sustainable Development Possible?**

- **Principles by Herman Daly (1970s):**
    
    1. Cannot consume natural resources faster than their replenishment.
    2. Cannot produce waste faster than nature’s recycling ability.
- **Examples of Sustainable Practices:**
    
    - **Fair Trade Organizations:** Support small producers using traditional methods for global markets.
    - **Energy Transition Examples:**
        - **Kenya (2015):** Over 50% electricity from geothermal, wind, and solar.
        - **Uruguay:** Achieved 95% renewable electricity due to policy commitments.
        - **Costa Rica:** Close to 100% renewable energy via geothermal.
        - **Nicaragua (2020):** Aimed for 90% renewable energy.
- **Non-Resource-Intensive Growth:**
    
    - Focus areas: Arts, education, entertainment, and services.

### **Major Themes of Sustainable Development**

1. **Interdependence:** Interconnection between environment, economy, and society.
2. **Global Equity:** Reduce poverty and inequalities to achieve sustainability.
3. **Environmental Limits:** Recognize finite resources and Earth's waste absorption capacity.
4. **Sustainable Economic Growth:** Encourage resource-conserving, long-term growth.

### **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

- **Initiated by the UN (2016):**
    - 17 goals aimed to be achieved by 2030.
    - Focus: Eliminate poverty, hunger, promote health, education, gender equality, and protect biodiversity.

#### **Examples of Goals:**

- **Goal 1:** End poverty.
    - Includes basic services, economic rights, and equitable resource distribution.

### **Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)**

- **Period:** 2000-2015.
- **Goals:** Improve literacy, health, water access, child survival, gender equity, etc.
- **Achievements:**
    - Extreme poverty reduced: From 50% → 14%.
    - Undernourished people dropped: 23% → 13%.
    - Primary school enrollment rose: 83% → 91%.
    - Progress in gender equity (education, employment, political representation).

#### **Challenges:**

- Over 40% of the world’s population lacks piped drinking water.

### **Wealthy Countries and Development Spending**

- **Jeffrey Sachs (UN Millennium Development Project):**
    
    - Proposal: End extreme poverty by 2025 with 0.7% of national income from richer countries.
- **Current Spending:**
    
    - USA: Allocates 0.2% GDP for development aid.
    - **UNDP Estimates:** $135 billion/year required to abolish extreme poverty and infectious diseases.
    - Military spending equals total income of half the world people.
    - A single large aircraft carrier equals 10 years of human development aid given by all world's industrailzed countries.
- **Perspective:**
    
    - Comparable to $120 billion/year U.S. oil subsidies.
    - Less than $1 trillion in global military spending.
