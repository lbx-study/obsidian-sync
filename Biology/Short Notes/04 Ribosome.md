### **Ribosome: Cellular Machinery for Protein Synthesis**

#### **Structure and Composition**

- **Definition:** Ribosomes are macromolecular machines responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating mRNA sequences into amino acid chains.
- **Subunits:**
    - **Prokaryotic Ribosomes (70S):**
        - Large subunit (50S): Contains 23S rRNA, 5S rRNA, and proteins.
        - Small subunit (30S): Contains 16S rRNA and proteins.
    - **Eukaryotic Ribosomes (80S):**
        - Large subunit (60S): Contains 28S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, 5S rRNA, and proteins.
        - Small subunit (40S): Contains 18S rRNA and proteins.
- **Chloroplasts and Mitochondria:**
    - Contain 70S ribosomes similar to bacteria, emphasizing their evolutionary origins from prokaryotes (endosymbiotic theory).

#### **Experimental Advances**

1. **Site of Protein Synthesis:**
    
    - **Paul Zamecnik's 1950s Experiment:**
        - Injected radioactive amino acids into rats.
        - Subcellular fractionation by centrifugation revealed that radioactive proteins localized to ribosomes, confirming them as the site of protein synthesis.
2. **Amino Acid Activation:**
    
    - **Mahlon Hoagland and Zamecnik:**
        - Showed amino acids were "activated" for protein synthesis by binding to ATP and attaching to transfer RNA (tRNA).
        - **tRNA Function:**
            - Identified as an adaptor molecule that translates mRNA codons into amino acids.
        - Activation catalyzed by **aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases**, specific to each amino acid.
3. **Ribosomal Subunit Reconstitution:**
    
    - **Masayasu Nomura:**
        - Demonstrated that ribosomal subunits could be disassembled into rRNA and proteins and reconstituted in vitro, proving their modular structure.
4. **Structural Insights:**
    
    - High-resolution structures of bacterial ribosomes were determined by **Venki Ramakrishnan**, **Thomas Steitz**, **Ada Yonath**, and others.
    - Revealed how ribosomes bind mRNA and tRNA during translation and catalyze peptide bond formation.

### **Protein Synthesis and Translation**

#### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Ribosomes:** Site of protein synthesis.
2. **mRNA:** Carries genetic instructions from DNA as codons.
3. **tRNA:** Adaptor molecules that deliver specific amino acids to the ribosome.
4. **Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases:** Enzymes that attach amino acids to their corresponding tRNA.
5. **Energy Sources:** ATP and GTP for tRNA charging and translation.

#### **Stages of Translation:**

1. **Initiation:**
    - Ribosome assembles on the mRNA at the start codon (AUG, encoding methionine).
    - Initiator tRNA binds to the P-site of the ribosome.
2. **Elongation:**
    - Codon-anticodon pairing occurs in the A-site.
    - Peptidyl transferase catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds.
    - Ribosome translocates along mRNA, moving the growing peptide chain to the P-site.
3. **Termination:**
    - Translation stops at a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA).
    - Release factors dissociate the ribosome and release the completed polypeptide.

### **Decoding the Genetic Code**

#### **Key Experiments:**

1. **Nirenberg and Matthaei (1961):**
    
    - Used synthetic RNA (e.g., poly-U) to demonstrate that specific codons direct the incorporation of specific amino acids.
    - Found that UUU encodes phenylalanine.
2. **Hargovind Khorana:**
    
    - Synthesized RNA sequences with repeating patterns to decipher additional codons.
    - Example: Alternating UC-UC RNA encodes repeating Ser-Leu amino acids.

#### **Features of the Genetic Code:**

- **Triplet Code:** Three nucleotides (codon) encode one amino acid.
- **Degeneracy:** Multiple codons can specify the same amino acid (e.g., GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG for glycine).
- **Start Codon:** AUG (methionine) signals the initiation of translation.
- **Stop Codons:** UAA, UAG, UGA signal termination of translation.

### **Key Concepts and Applications**

#### **The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:**

- Information flow:
    - **DNA → RNA → Protein.**
- Transcription (in nucleus): DNA is transcribed into mRNA.
- Translation (in cytoplasm): mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes.

#### **Ribosomal Role in Translation:**

- Ribosome ensures accuracy in mRNA decoding through codon-anticodon pairing.
- Peptidyl transferase (rRNA-based enzymatic activity) catalyzes peptide bond formation.

#### **Experimental Techniques:**

- **Differential Centrifugation:**
    - Used to isolate ribosomes and other organelles for study.
- **Equilibrium Density-Gradient Centrifugation:**
    - Separates ribosomal subunits based on their buoyant density.

### **Ribosomes Across Domains**

- **Bacteria:** Simpler, smaller ribosomes (70S).
- **Eukaryotes:** Larger, more complex ribosomes (80S).
- **Endosymbiotic Organelles:** Chloroplasts and mitochondria have prokaryote-like ribosomes, supporting their evolutionary origin.

### **Modern Applications and Discoveries**

- **Ribosome-Targeting Antibiotics:**
    - Certain antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, erythromycin) inhibit bacterial ribosomes while sparing eukaryotic ribosomes, making them effective treatments for infections.
- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM):**
    - High-resolution imaging of ribosomes has revealed dynamic processes during translation.

### **Summary**

Ribosomes are the central cellular machinery for translating genetic information into functional proteins. Groundbreaking experiments in the mid-20th century elucidated the role of ribosomes, tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in protein biosynthesis. The genetic code, discovered through pioneering studies by Nirenberg, Khorana, and others, forms the foundation of molecular biology. Ribosomes, highly conserved across domains, remain a focal point for understanding translation, antibiotic development, and molecular evolution.
