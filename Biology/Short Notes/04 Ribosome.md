### **Ribosome: Cellular Machinery for Protein Synthesis**

#### **Structure and Composition**

- **Ribosomes** are large complexes of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and proteins.
- Composed of two subunits:
    - **Prokaryotic Ribosomes (70S):** Made of 50S and 30S subunits.
    - **Eukaryotic Ribosomes (80S):** Made of 60S and 40S subunits.
    - **Similarity:** Ribosomes in chloroplasts and mitochondria are similar to bacterial ribosomes.

#### **Experimental Advances**

1. **Site of Protein Synthesis:**
    - In the 1950s, Paul Zamecnik used radioactive amino acids in rats to localize protein synthesis to ribosomes.
2. **Activation of Amino Acids:**
    - Mahlon Hoagland and Zamecnik discovered amino acids are activated by ATP and linked to tRNA by **aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases**.
    - Transfer RNA (tRNA), identified by Robert Holley, serves as an adaptor between mRNA codons and amino acids.
3. **Decoding Genetic Information:**
    - tRNA translates the 4-letter nucleotide code into the 20-letter amino acid code, enabling the mRNA-guided synthesis of polypeptides (translation).

### **Protein Synthesis and Translation**

#### **Requirements**

- **Key Components:**
    1. Ribosomes (site of protein synthesis).
    2. mRNA (carries genetic instructions).
    3. tRNA (binds to specific amino acids).
    4. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (enzymes that link amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs).

### **Decoding the Genetic Code**

#### **Key Contributions**

1. **Nirenberg and Matthaei's Experiments:**
    - Used synthetic RNA molecules to establish that codons (triplets of nucleotides) determine amino acid sequences.
2. **Hargovind Khorana's Work:**
    - Synthesized polyribonucleotides with defined repeating sequences.
    - Revealed patterns of amino acids encoded by specific nucleotide sequences.

#### **Genetic Code Basics**

- There are **20 common amino acids**.
- A 4-letter nucleotide system in groups of two is insufficient (16 combinations).
- A 4-letter system in groups of three (triplet code) provides 64 combinations, enough to encode all amino acids.
- **Key Features:**
    - Universal.
    - Redundant (multiple codons per amino acid).
    - Triplet-based.

### **Notable Experimental Findings**

1. **Reconstitution of Ribosomal Subunits:**
    - Masayasu Nomura demonstrated that ribosomal subunits could be broken down into RNA and protein components and reassembled in vitro.
2. **Structural Insights:**
    - High-resolution structures of bacterial ribosomal subunits were determined by Venki Ramakrishnan, Thomas Steitz, Ada Yonath, Harry Noller, and others.

### **The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

- Information flows:
    - **DNA → RNA → Protein**.
- Protein synthesis involves two key steps:
    1. **Transcription:** DNA to RNA.
    2. **Translation:** RNA to protein.

### **Summary**

- Ribosomes are essential organelles responsible for translating genetic information into functional proteins.
- Key experimental advances (e.g., by Zamecnik, Hoagland, Nirenberg, and Khorana) laid the foundation for understanding protein biosynthesis.
- The genetic code, consisting of triplet nucleotide codons, is universal and forms the basis for translation.
- Ribosomal structures and mechanisms continue to be a cornerstone of molecular biology research.
