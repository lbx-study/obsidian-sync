### Structured Notes on "Lysosome and Vacuole"

---

### **Lysosomes**

#### **Overview**

- **Structure:** Membrane-enclosed organelles containing 50+ degradative enzymes for breaking down biological polymers.
- **Function:** Intracellular digestion of external materials and obsolete cellular components.

#### **Digestive Pathways**

1. **Endocytosis:** Uptake of molecules from outside the cell.
2. **Phagocytosis:** Ingestion of large particles like bacteria and cellular debris by professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils).
    - Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes for degradation.
3. **Autophagy:** Recycling of damaged or unnecessary cellular components.

#### **Key Features**

- **Highly Glycosylated Membrane Proteins:** Protect lysosomal membranes from degradation by hydrolytic enzymes.
- **Glycocalyx:** Layer of oligosaccharides that shields the lysosomal membrane from hydrolytic destruction.
- **Transport of Enzymes:** Lysosomal hydrolases are tagged with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) in the Golgi apparatus for targeted delivery to lysosomes.

#### **Role in Genetic Diseases**

- Mutations in lysosomal enzyme genes cause lysosomal storage diseases:
    - **Gaucher’s Disease:** Mutation in glycolipid-degrading enzyme.
    - **I-Cell Disease:** Deficiency in enzyme tagging lysosomal enzymes with M6P.

#### **Role in Cholesterol Regulation**

- Cholesterol uptake via **receptor-mediated endocytosis**:
    - LDL (low-density lipoprotein) particles are internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles.
    - Disruption in LDL receptor genes results in cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis.

### **Vacuoles**

#### **Overview**

- **Structure:** Large vesicles in plant and fungal cells, surrounded by a membrane called the **tonoplast**.
- **Function:** Perform roles similar to lysosomes in plants but also have plant-specific functions.

#### **Key Functions in Plants**

1. **Hydrolytic Activity:** Contains enzymes for degrading old or damaged proteins and organelles.
2. **Turgor Pressure Maintenance:**
    - Helps cells withstand environmental changes by controlling osmotic pressure.
    - Regulates cytosolic pH by fluxing H⁺ ions between vacuole and cytosol.
3. **Storage:**
    - Stores ions, amino acids, carbohydrates, pigments (e.g., anthocyanins), and waste.
    - Reserves proteins in seed storage cells, which are later hydrolyzed during germination.
4. **Defense Mechanism:**
    - Stores noxious molecules for predator deterrence.
5. **Pigmentation:** Stores pigments for flower coloration to attract pollinators.
6. **Buffering:** Recycles ions, amino acids, and metals to maintain cellular homeostasis.

#### **Formation**

- Vacuoles form through the fusion of **multivesicular bodies** derived from the Golgi apparatus.

#### **Electron Micrograph Observation**

- Vacuoles occupy 30–90% of plant cell volume and are surrounded by a thin layer called the tonoplast.

### **Specialized Processes**

#### **Phagocytosis (Specialized Endocytosis)**

- **In Protozoa:** Used for feeding.
- **In Animals:**
    - Performed by professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils).
    - Ingest microorganisms, damaged cells, or debris.

#### **Electron Micrographs of Phagocytosis**

- Examples:
    - Mouse macrophage engulfing red blood cells.
    - Neutrophil ingesting a bacterium.

#### **Plant-Specific Osmotic Pressure Control**

- Maintains osmotic balance by altering rates of:
    - Breakdown/re-synthesis of biopolymers.
    - Transport of sugars, amino acids, and metabolites across plasma and vacuolar membranes.

### **Key Points**

- Lysosomes and vacuoles share hydrolytic functions but differ in occurrence and additional roles.
- Vacuoles perform plant-specific tasks like turgor maintenance, pigment storage, and pH regulation.
- Both organelles are vital for cellular homeostasis and adaptability to environmental changes.
